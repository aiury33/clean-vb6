# Clean VB6

I developed this project with the goal of achieving the cleanest and most encapsulated software design possible **using VB6**. 
I applied some **SOLID** principles to create an application that, even in the absence of object-oriented features in VB6, would still have a minimum level of simplicity and healthy reuse of concepts. 
The program connects to SQL databases (which I called "clean" here) and performs stock movements (inserts and updates) for a specific product from a particular company. 
The repository includes a SQL script called "prepare_database" that does exactly what the name suggests, and the project is segregated into folders.
